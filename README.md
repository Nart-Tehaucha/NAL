## Tech Stack

**Client:** Vue.js, Bootstrap

**Server:** Django, DRC

## Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/Nart-Tehaucha/NAL.git
    $ cd nal

### Virtual Environment (`venv`)

While there are a few ways to achieve a programming environment in Python, we’ll be using the venv module here, which is part of the standard Python 3 library. Let’s install venv by typing:

    $ sudo apt install python3-venv

Creating and entering a new virtual environment:

    $ python3 -m venv env
    $ . env/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

You can ensure that you're in your new virutal Environment if you see `(env)` prepend your bash shell:

    (env) user@ubuntu:~/nal$ 

### Running the project

    $ python3 manage.py runserver

Once the server has started up, you can visit it at [localhost:8000/](localhost:8000/), or [127.0.0.1:8000/](127.0.0.1:8000/).
